# HavenOS provenance and integration audit — 2026-08-30

## Scope and safety invariant

Authoritative target: `havenos-main` @ `7b2acae6175e5c380a3812b531b90ca82dbf85c3` (`docs: complete HavenOS provenance SHAs`).

QA lane: `havenos/worker/qa-provenance-integration-20260830`, created from that target. This QA lane changed only this report. No product branch/worktree was deleted, reset, cleaned, stashed, rebased, force-pushed, or rewritten. Dirty and otherwise unverified work remains retained.

## Provenance and licensing

`docs/HAVENOS-COMPOSITION-PROVENANCE.md` records eight source and composition anchors. All eight source SHAs resolve in `CroakyJake12/HavenAI`:

1. Write — `f038d52191b2e8558e6036a25eda8f9ce79dbf70`
2. Browse — `ec48a80d4da14f80dbb4f578a17f170ae70ddd5b`
3. Data Spreadsheet — `8e778b70dfa3cddb0ccc3ff1b9481017ac21830a`
4. Data Database — `ef3ee8782504e64e4114a9c58605f6299aef37ca`
5. Quick Settings — `74a3866b44a7aaa34d9ff7f2e53883d6cd43193f`
6. Projector — `6bd5f5424a28e8b54bf78579f7a7f75baefac80a`
7. Shell launcher — `06614a2195f2290da5b32b207ead968dafd07827`
8. Linux packaging — `7e930d149979f80222737ffaf23e509580bcd140`

Commit-chain provenance is therefore internally consistent, but the ledger does not identify donor repository/origin or license. The recursive `havenos-main` tree has no license-named file and root `LICENSE` is absent. Distribution/license clearance is therefore **unproven** until a first-party ownership statement or donor/license manifest is added. This is a compliance gate, not an allegation of infringement.

The current Dev, Terminal, Write, Canvas, HUI Core, and shell/taskbar slices inspected here reuse repository-local Haven contracts/surfaces rather than adding copied third-party source. Dev explicitly excludes Visual Studio extension source from its lane. That does not remove the repository-level licensing gap.

## Branch/commit hygiene and integration readiness

`havenos-main` is unprotected, has no required status checks, and its head commit is unsigned. A refreshed search found no open PRs matching current `havenos/worker` lanes. All 12 product heads ahead of `havenos-main` in the final ref snapshot have empty combined commit-status sets. Every product head below is 0 commits behind the authoritative base.

| Lane | Head | Ahead | Scope | Gate |
| --- | --- | ---: | --- | --- |
| `os-gnome-platform` | `61e4f6102d629758557ded95272778ab996df4fc` | 1 | `docs/`, `scripts/linux/`, `tests/linux/` | **HOLD** — caller-supplied GNOME SHA is only format-checked, not bound to source content/HEAD. |
| `hui-core` | `29430290758553d94fc5f7f91d03ddf429a36ffa` | 1 | `src/Haven.UI/` + tests | **HOLD-PLACEMENT/TEST** — confirm existing shared HUI tree satisfies the HavenOS-root ownership rule; independently test. |
| `os-performance-capabilities` | `1f84fdd0e70af03bf7e20653d0fe66e9824dbfc9` | 2 | `src/Haven.Infrastructure/...` + tests | **HOLD-PLACEMENT/TEST** — resolve/coordinate OS-root platform-service ownership; independently test. |
| `os-wine-compatibility` | `0369902f0afb25b0eed8a03f7b88ffd3063b123d` | 1 | `src/Haven.Infrastructure/WindowsCompatibility/...` + tests | **HOLD-PLACEMENT/TEST**. |
| `os-llm-runtime` | `fcc5c9c77b5fd5dec967a3b23031a306db744dd8` | 2 | docs + `src/Haven.Application` / `src/Haven.Infrastructure` + tests | **HOLD-PLACEMENT/TEST** — docs call this OS-root while code remains in legacy `src/`. |
| `os-apk-launcher` | `5cd6dcfe97be9d6fc7248efe9392e4651b03a628` | 2 | `src/Haven.Application` / `src/Haven.Infrastructure` + tests | **HOLD-PLACEMENT/TEST**. |
| `os-shell-taskbar` | `e1d0a9c123211b1dcef0ac8ecc71d09349df9f15` | 1 | shared `src/Haven.Desktop` shell + tests | **HOLD-REVIEW/TEST** — changes active shell chrome from top rail placement to bottom taskbar; shared-shell ownership/regression review required. |
| `dev-app` | `6ac2b1067c9f97694afd424a2c029d51854c2f7e` | 1 | `HavenOS Apps/Dev/` only | **HOLD-TEST** — correct app placement; no independent build/test evidence. |
| `terminal-app` | `054cea541580273711f545ba53df1c3e56ef7c51` | 1 | `HavenOS Apps/Terminal/` only | **HOLD-TEST** — correct app placement and fail-closed host capability design; independently run specs. |
| `canvas-app` | `68a3c40ae5340acf2dc66945cf8328362d05df19` | 1 | `HavenOS Apps/Canvas/` only | **HOLD-TEST** — correct isolated app placement; no independent build/CI evidence. |
| `write-app` | `49a937ebc24f3aa92df3dcb0dc1e22cf79c372d6` | 1 | `HavenOS Apps/Write/` + shared Desktop project/test wiring | **HOLD-COORD/TEST** — coordinate shared `Haven.Desktop.csproj`/test ownership, then independently test. |
| `os-linux-packaging-runtime` | `047795641210cb3d2c9bc993626be20bee330edf` | 2 | `.github/workflows/`, `eng/` | **HOLD-TEST/LICENSE** — no independent final publish/package evidence; distribution license metadata unproven. |

Thirteen other current worker branches remained exactly at baseline SHA `7b2acae6175e5c380a3812b531b90ca82dbf85c3` in the final matching-ref snapshot and therefore had no remote product slice to merge: `boards-app`, `browse-app`, `data-app`, `hui-accessibility-performance`, `hui-android`, `hui-desktop`, `images-app`, `motion-app`, `os-settings-model-picker`, `present-app`, `qa-functional-release`, `spaces-app`, and `wave-app`.

Baseline-only is **not** a deletion signal. A branch can still have local active/uncommitted work.

## Exact conditional merge queue

No product branch is authorized for immediate merge by this audit. After each branch's stated gate is cleared, integrate in this order and re-compare all remaining heads after every merge:

1. `havenos/worker/os-gnome-platform-20260830` @ `61e4f6102d629758557ded95272778ab996df4fc`
2. `havenos/worker/hui-core-20260830` @ `29430290758553d94fc5f7f91d03ddf429a36ffa`
3. `havenos/worker/os-performance-capabilities-20260830` @ `1f84fdd0e70af03bf7e20653d0fe66e9824dbfc9`
4. `havenos/worker/os-wine-compatibility-20260830` @ `0369902f0afb25b0eed8a03f7b88ffd3063b123d`
5. `havenos/worker/os-llm-runtime-20260830` @ `fcc5c9c77b5fd5dec967a3b23031a306db744dd8`
6. `havenos/worker/os-apk-launcher-20260830` @ `5cd6dcfe97be9d6fc7248efe9392e4651b03a628`
7. `havenos/worker/os-shell-taskbar-20260830` @ `e1d0a9c123211b1dcef0ac8ecc71d09349df9f15`
8. `havenos/worker/dev-app-20260830` @ `6ac2b1067c9f97694afd424a2c029d51854c2f7e`
9. `havenos/worker/terminal-app-20260830` @ `054cea541580273711f545ba53df1c3e56ef7c51`
10. `havenos/worker/canvas-app-20260830` @ `68a3c40ae5340acf2dc66945cf8328362d05df19`
11. `havenos/worker/write-app-20260830` @ `49a937ebc24f3aa92df3dcb0dc1e22cf79c372d6`
12. `havenos/worker/os-linux-packaging-runtime-20260830` @ `047795641210cb3d2c9bc993626be20bee330edf`

Rationale: provenance/platform/HUI foundations first, shared shell next, isolated app surfaces after that, shared Write wiring late, and final packaging tooling/validation last. Do not mechanically merge a queued SHA if its head advances, `havenos-main` moves, or changed paths begin to overlap.

## Worktree preservation gate

Sandbox preflight exposed ten dirty legacy agent worktrees. They are an explicit **do-not-delete/do-not-retire** set until captured and independently verified:

- `agent/a01-a02-hub-spaces-20260829`
- `agent/r11-build-ci-arm64-windows-portability-20260829`
- `agent/r04-hui-linux-gnome-20260829`
- `agent/r10-hardware-linux-services-20260829`
- `agent/r08-packaging-lifecycle-permissions-20260829`
- `agent/r06-native-apk-runtime-20260829`
- `agent/r02-shared-platform-sdk-ipc-20260829`
- `agent/r05-native-exe-wine-20260829`
- `agent/r03-ubuntu-gnome-base-20260829`
- `agent/r01-programme-architecture-ledger-v2-20260829`

Other active clean worktrees are retained too: clean does not mean merged or independently verified.

## Validation performed and blocker

The Sandbox refused switching the registered Haven checkout to this QA branch because active task worktrees are registered. The refusal was respected. Therefore this lane could not independently execute local `dotnet`/shell builds or tests without disturbing active work.

Completed evidence instead:

- verified authoritative/base and QA branch identity;
- inspected repository tree for provenance/license records;
- resolved all eight existing source provenance anchors;
- compared all 12 current product heads to `havenos-main` for ahead/behind and changed paths;
- captured the final matching-ref inventory for current HavenOS worker branches;
- refreshed the open-PR search (none found);
- checked combined commit statuses for all 12 current product heads (all empty);
- captured active/dirty local worktree state;
- verified the QA audit branch changes only this report path relative to `havenos-main` at its first audit checkpoint.

## Blocking actions

1. Add repository ownership/license information plus donor manifests where imported code exists (source repo, immutable revision, SPDX/license, imported paths, attribution/notice requirements).
2. Bind GNOME source provenance to actual supplied source content/repository HEAD, not only a hex-shaped caller value.
3. Resolve or explicitly coordinate shared HUI/platform-runtime ownership/placement against the HavenOS-root rule.
4. Review the shell/taskbar shared integration and Write's shared Desktop wiring with the relevant owners.
5. Obtain independent focused build/test evidence for every queued SHA.
6. Add branch protection/required checks for `havenos-main` before routine multi-worker integration.
7. Preserve every dirty or unverified branch/worktree until its owner reports it captured and safe to retire.
